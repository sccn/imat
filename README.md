Independent Modulator Analysis Toolbox

## What is imat?
Independent Modulator Analysis is a method for decomposing spectral fluctuations of temporally independent EEG sources into ‘spatio-spectrally’ distinct spectral modulator processes ([Onton et al., 2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.09.061.2009/full)). Such processes might might derive from and isolate coordinated multiplicatively scaling effects of functionally near-independent modulatory factors, for example cortico-subcortical or sensory-cortical loops, or brainstem-centered import recognition systems linked to dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, etc.

Many studies of EEG spectral dynamics separate spectrographic data into a set of pre-defined broad or narrow frequency bands, then extract and operate on measures of these bands. However, to better understand the functional roles of local field dynamics contributing to the EEG, as well as individual differences in oscillatory dynamics, more flexible, data-driven models of spectral dynamics are needed. In the IMA method, multi-channel EEG data are first spatially decomposed using independent component analysis (ICA) into maximally independent component (IC) source processes. Then the temporal fluctuations in the concurrent joint IC log spectrograms are decomposed into independent modulator (IM) processes that are maximally independent over sources and frequency-weighting.
